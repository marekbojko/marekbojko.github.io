**Reducing Interview Congestion in Two-Sided Matching Markets Using Preference Signaling**<br>
[[Current Draft]](https://marekbojko.github.io/files/interviews_congestion_signaling.pdf) <br>
**Abstract:** The annual process of matching doctors to residency positions in the United States is preceded by costly information acquisition in the form of interviews. Interview allocation is determined in a decentralized equilibrium and often suffers from congestion. We model a tractable multi-stage game between hospitals and doctors highlighting this issue. Upon receiving applications, hospitals simultaneously extend interview offers with incomplete information about others' preferences and partial information about their own preferences, subject to a capacity constraint on their number of interviews. To reduce congestion, we consider a mechanism where each doctor can signal interest to one hospital. Whenever hospitals respond to signals in equilibrium, the signaling mechanism increases the ex-ante doctor welfare and the expected number of matches. The impact on hospital welfare, however, is ambiguous. The success of the mechanism depends on pre-interview uncertainty about the final match utilities. Hospitals are more likely to respond to signals when (i) doctors are ex-ante more similar and (ii) the pre-interview probability a hospital finds a doctor unacceptable is low.<br>

**The Probabilistic Serial and Random Priority Mechanisms with Minimum Quotas**<br>
[[Current Draft]](https://marekbojko.github.io/files/PS_RP_min_quotas.pdf)  <br>
**Abstract:** Consider the problem of assigning indivisible objects to agents with strict ordinal preferences over objects, where each agent is interested in consuming at most one object, and objects have integer minimum and maximum quotas. We define an assignment to be feasible if it satisfies all quotas and assume such an assignment always exists. The Probabilistic Serial (PS) and Random Priority (RP) mechanisms are generalised based on the same intuitive idea: Allow agents to consume their most preferred available object until the total mass of agents yet to be allocated is exactly equal to the remaining amount of unfilled lower quotas; in this case, we restrict agents' menus to objects which are yet to fill their minimum quotas. We show the mechanisms satisfy the same criteria as their classical counterparts: PS is ordinally efficient, envy-free and weakly strategy-proof; RP is strategy-proof, weakly envy-free but not ordinally efficient.
