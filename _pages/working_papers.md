**Reducing Interview Congestion in Two-Sided Matching Markets Using Preference Signaling** [Paper](files/interviews_congestion_signaling.pdf) <br>
<font size="3">**Abstract:**</font> <font size="2.75">Matching in many two-sided markets is preceded by costly information acquisition in the form of interviews. Interview allocation is determined in a decentralized equilibrium and often suffers from congestion. We consider a tractable multi-stage game between hospitals and doctors highlighting these issues. Upon receiving applications, hospitals simultaneously extend interview invitations subject to incomplete information about applicant preferences and partial information about their own preferences and subject to capacities on the number of interviews. To reduce congestion, we propose limited credible signaling of interest by doctors before interviews. Whenever hospitals respond to signals in equilibrium, the signaling mechanism strictly increases doctor welfare and the expected number of matches. The impact on hospital welfare is ambiguous. The success of the mechanism depends on pre-interview uncertainty about the final match utilities. Hospitals respond to signals more when (i) doctors are ex-ante more similar and (ii) the pre-interview probability a hospital finds a doctor unacceptable is low.</font>
